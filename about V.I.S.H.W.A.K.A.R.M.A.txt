Emergency response support

 Base Platform:
4WD chassis with 12V 200RPM geared motors

Controlled via ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

Communication via Wi-Fi socket or desktop app with python

Power from Li-ion battery pack + regulated rails (buck converters)

🧠 AI Capabilities:
Road/path detection via OpenCV

Future support for object/person detection

360° environment monitoring

Modular autonomous task execution

⚙️ Main Feature: Modular Attachments (8 Total)
All modules are custom-attachable and work independently or together based on the mission.
